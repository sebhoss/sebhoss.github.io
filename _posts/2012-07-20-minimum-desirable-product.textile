Define MDP, yadada

I'm going to give you a mission statement exercise that I stole from famed marketer/author Marty Neumeier (I had constructed a similar framework on my own, but his is way better and easier - he's the best branding/messaging author nobody speaks about, steal all his books):

o WHAT: Rocketr is the ONLY___________________
o HOW: that _______________________________
o WHO: for _________________________________
o WHERE: in __________________________________
o WHY: who ________________________________
o WHEN: in an era of __________________________.

Find two examples from Marty below that reveal the format details:

Example #1:
o WHAT: Harley Davidson is the ONLY motorcycle manufacturer
o HOW: that makes big, loud motorcycles
o WHO: for macho guys (and macho "wannabees")
o WHERE: in the United States (mostly)
o WHY: who want to join a gang of cowboys
o WHEN: in an era of decreasing personal freedom.

Example #2:
o WHAT: The White Stripes are the ONLY pop music duo
o HOW: that records crude yet hip rock songs
o WHO: for young urbanites
o WHERE: in the United States and other first-world countries
o WHY: who long for authenticity
o WHEN: in an era of overproduced, me-too music.
