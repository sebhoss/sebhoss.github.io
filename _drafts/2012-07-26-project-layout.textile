Required:

* */src* contains the projects source code
* *LICENSE* contains the projects license
* *README* contains the projects introduction (aka read me)
* *CONTRIBUTING* contains information for future committers on how to contribute.

SCM specific:
* *.gitignore* lists files ignored by git. This list should include all source files that are generated/derived from checked-in source files. Rule of thumb is: Can it be generated? If yes, then include in .gitignore.
