* Most of the time views such as _Console_ or _Problems_ are not actively used. Therefore minimize those and regain more free space for code. After minimizing they are still available with a single click on their specific icon. Clicking outside of the then opened popup closes the dialog (quick peek).
* The default workspace encoding is by default set to the platform default. Change this to *UTF-8* or whatever you want to use.
